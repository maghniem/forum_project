<p><b>Cezar Batto – President/Co-Founder</b>
<p>As a highly educated and knowledgeable graduate with two degrees with in-depth knowledge in travel and web development, WindsorMania is a project I co-started that is dear to me. I genuinely desire to be an integral part of a team research initiative in order to bring our users the best web experience possible.

<p><b>Prabhjit Singh – Custodian</b>
<p>	I am currently a student at University of Windsor studying Comptuer Science &amp I also have a degree in Biology. Even with all the studying, I have taken a custodian position at WindsorMania in order to pay for my education debt.  I have come to love this place with all my heart, and would do anything to make sure it remains spotless.
